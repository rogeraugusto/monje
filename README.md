## Monje
**Monje** is a tool that allows to manage and control the device access to network resources, through an authentication and validation interface with the registered user. 
The proposed development collects device information upon joining the network, and conditions it to security levels based on rules for flow control and redirection. 
The key element of this approach is the linkage between the MAC of the device and its reserved, system-controlled IP address. Once authorized, access to the network is granted without the need for authentication, which will be required for new devices not known by the tool.
